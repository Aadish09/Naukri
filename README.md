#Daily Naukri Update

###Selenium and Python powered automation script

This script is used to automate information update on the job portal "Naukri". Most recruiters filter users having the most recent updates on their profile. Using this script run on schedule everyday, this task can be completed in seconds.
(for which I took only couple hours to develop from scratch :D )

In order to use this, you need to have Python 3 and Selenium webdriver installed in your machine.
